The model is highly effective, achieving an average confidence of 90%, an average inference time of 76.92 milliseconds, and a compact model size of 8.1 MB. It is specifically designed for resource-constrained environments, such as kiosks and other embedded systems, making it ideal for scenarios requiring high accuracy and fast inference speed within limited computing resources.
